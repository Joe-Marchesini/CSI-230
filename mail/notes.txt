Joe Marchesini Notes:

10/22/2020:
- Created nukeusers.sh without issue
- Created emails.txt
- Created mail.sh
  Issues:
  - Ran into an issue with usage() not poping up a message when -f wasnt used properly
  - Struggled to find out how to randomly generate a password for a while until I found out the correct openssl command insed of the rsa key creation.
  - Struggled to add user, password wouldnt work until I cound the openssl comand to fix that.
  - Ran out of time to implement emailing, wasnt able to get it done.
